Best way to get all Ips in Local Net is by disabling DNS reverse
resolution:
		sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.1-255
	this will scan all 255 hosts in IP range 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.255
Next mode will create a easily parse-able file:
		sudo nmap -sn -oG output.txt 192.168.1.1-255

This mode will only find Windows hosts with sharing enabled.
		sudo nmap -sU --script nbstat.nse -p137 192.168.1.*
Although, will still work with Network Sharing disabled. Only requires Network Discovery be
enabled, which is the default for Private networks.

This mode will try to guess the services on the running ports.
	sudo nmap -sS -sV -vv 192.168.56.101
