Where Does routing occur within the DoD(Department of Defense) TCP/IP reference model?
	# Internet Layer
Layer 4 > 1

A network interface port has collision detection and carrier sensing
enabled on shared twisted pair network.What can I say for this network?
	# It is an ethernet port operating at half duplex.
		(FULL Dplx & Half Dplx )
		------------------------
        	Get and send datas with same time.(FLL)
        	Only one operation to do with same time. (HALF)

Which layer in the OSI reference model is responsible 
for determining the availability of the receiving 
program and checking to see if enough resources exist for that communication?

# Application! The application layer is responsible for identifying and establishing
the availablility of the inteded communication partner and determning wheter
sufficient resources for the inteded communication exist.


A router has two Fast Ethernet interfaces and needs to connect to four VLANs in the local
network. How can you accomplish this task, using the fewest physical interfaces and
without decreasing network performance?

# Implement a router-on-a-stick configuration.
A router on a stick allows you to use sub-interfaces
to create multiple logical networks on a single physical interface.
