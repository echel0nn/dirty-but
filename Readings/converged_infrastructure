	Converged infrastructure is an approach to data center management that seeks to minimize compatibility issues between server,
storage systems and network devices while also reducing cost for cabling, cooling, power and floor space. A converged infrastructrure can be implemented with a CI reference architecture, with standalone appliances or with a software driven hyper-converged approach.

	With a CI reference architecture approach to converged infrastructure
  the vendor provides the customer with pre-tested recommendations for how best
  to use hardware components in the data center to meet requirements specific workloads.

	With an IT appliance approach to CI, the vendor provides
	the customer with a single box that houses tightly integrated
	compute, storage, networking virtualization resources from the
	vendor and perphaps the vendor's partners. Should the need arise,
 	additional appliances can be purschased and added, a concept known
	as horizontal scalability.

	With a hyper-converged approach, the vendor abstracts compute,
	networking and stroage resources from the physical hardware, bundling
	virualization software with their CI offerings. Hyper-converged vendors
	may also provide additional functionality for cloud bursting or disaster
	recovery and allow administrators to manage both physical and virtual
	infrastructures --whether on-site or in the cloud -- in a federated manner
	with a single pane of glass.
